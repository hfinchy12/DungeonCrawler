# DungeonCrawler
Dungeon Crawler game made in C++
This game was created in my Program Design class. In this game, the player must escape from the dungeon they are trapped in. Inside the dungeon are monsters, treasures, and a few magical suprises. The different dungeons are read in from text files and loaded onto 2D dynamically-allocated arrays. All the maps are validated to ensure the robustness of the program.
